2025-12-08 21:00:56,327 - __main__ - INFO - Agent says: Yes, I understand what you're saying. You're suggesting that the system should only finalize the transcript after longer pauses, rather than after every short pause or breath. This approach would better reflect natural speech patterns. Do you have any specific criteria in mind for what constitutes a "long pause"?

2025-12-08 21:01:35,348 - __main__ - INFO - Agent says: It sounds like you're asking about best practices in communication, particularly in voice interaction, while also considering the role of stop words. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Clarity and Conciseness**: Strive to be clear and to the point. Avoid unnecessary jargon or complex language that might confuse the listener.

2. **Active Listening**: Engage with the speaker by acknowledging their points and responding appropriately. This builds rapport and improves understanding.

3. **Natural Language**: Use conversational language that feels natural. This includes using some stop words, as they help mimic the flow of natural speech.

4. **Context Awareness**: Tailor your responses based on the context of the conversation. This helps ensure that your replies are relevant

2025-12-08 21:02:38,970 - __main__ - INFO - Agent says: When designing a conversational AI to handle pauses effectively, it's important to consider the natural rhythm of human speech. Here are some strategies it can employ:

1. **Natural Pauses**: Acknowledge that pauses can be a natural part of conversation. The AI should be programmed to recognize and allow for pauses that occur between thoughts or sentences, giving users time to process information.

2. **Context Awareness**: The AI should be aware of the context. For example, if the user asks a complex question, a longer pause might be appropriate before the AI responds, indicating it is thinking or processing the information.

3. **Turn-Taking**: Implement turn-taking cues where the AI indicates it is ready for the user to respond, perhaps by using
